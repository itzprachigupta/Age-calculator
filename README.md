An age calculator is a tool or application designed to determine a person's age based on their date of birth and the current date. It is a convenient way to find out exactly how old someone is without manually calculating it.This age calculator calculates your age in years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds.
The age calculator typically requires you to input two pieces of information:
1. Date of Birth (DOB): This is the date when the person was born, including the day, month, and year.
2. Current Date: The present date when you are using the age calculator.
Using these two inputs, the age calculator will perform a simple calculation to determine the person's age in years, months, and days. The process generally involves comparing the DOB with the current date and then subtracting the birth year from the current year to get the number of years. If the birth month and day are not reached yet in the current year, the age calculator may deduct one more year to adjust for the remaining time.

This calculator uses various javascript functions such as Date module to perform various calculations required in finding age.
